The following documentation describes the fundamentals of the protocol and how to interact with it. Please join the [#dev](https://discord.gg/wma7JaTUng) room in the [WeFarm community Discord](https://discord.gg/yk9jDwU8zq) server; our team and members of the community look forward to helping you build on top of WeFarm.

### Basic overview

The WeFarm protocol codebase is hosted on Github.

The protocol is implemented as a set of **smart contracts** on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts guarantee safety and do not require a middleman. 

Users and applications can interact directly with the smart contracts, the blockchain data, or via their favorite web3 providers.

WeFarm Protocol is developed with security as a priority, having been audited by multiple auditors.

For a deeper dive into the protocol, economics, and how it works, refer to the White Paper.
